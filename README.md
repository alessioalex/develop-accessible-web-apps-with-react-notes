## About

This repo contains notes from [Erin Doyle](https://twitter.com/SunshinyDoyle)'s [Develop Accessible Web Apps with React Notes](https://egghead.io/courses/develop-accessible-web-apps-with-react).

These notes contain the same structure as the transcriptions, along with additional rewrites, links to resources, and personal takes on the lesson. Feel free to submit additions to these notes, but please don't remove anything (unless we messed up or misunderstood something).

Generally, there is one document for each lesson in the course. If there are related lessons, the notes will be in the same document.
